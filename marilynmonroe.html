		<p>Marilyn Monroe became the dazzling icon of the the 40s and 50s, bringing her beauty and talent into the movie industry. However, not everything was all praise for Monroe. She was one of the first women to express herself as an activist, for both gender equality and sexual assault. In the biography Goddess: The Secret Life of Marilyn Monroe, the actress revealed that she "spent a great deal of time on my knees" over her career. 
		She was repeatedly silenced by men in positions of power, and later she said, "Most of the men are such horrors. they deserve all they can get out of them!"</p>

Shirley Temple revealed that in 1940, when she was 12, an MGM producer exposed his body parts to her during their meeting. Dame Joan Collins tested for the leading role of Cleopatra in the 1963 film, but lost it when she refused to sleep with the studio boss.Dame Helen Mirren was sexualized during an interview with TV director Michael Winner.<p>

		<p>She was to get away from the orphanage at the age of 16, by marrying a man who was 21. Throughout the next years of her life, she endured two other happy yet unhappy marriages. Monroe managed to record her anguish in poems and diaries, including the fact that those who surrounded her career didn't care for her. Even many of her fans recognized her ONLY for the character she played, which was always the stereotypical "dumb blonde".
		Many believed Marilyn was just a desperate woman who wanted fame and love life, but in reality she was a woman with a horrible past who needed family and true love(family, friends, others).
