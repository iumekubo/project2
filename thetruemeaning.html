	<h5>I wanted to create this website on something that sparked my mind. I thought that telling some behind the scenes stories of celebrities could bring awareness.
	It would bring not just awareness to sexual assault, but also to be mindful. There is still major inequality in of of the world's most loved industries. I hope overall this website has told
	an inspiring story that leads us to continue a happy and healthy environment for everyone. However, I'm not telling you NOT to pursue a career in Hollywood, go ahead and do it! 
	P.S equal rights woohoo!<h5>
